2. No, you don't get an error because the condition 0 < 0 is false, so the body of the 'if' is skipped

3. Well, we learned that deleting an element from an ArrayList just shifts all the elements after it to the left in order to close the gap, so this isn't that surprising

4. private ArrayList<Book> Library;

5. ArrayList<Student> cs101;

6. private ArrayList<MusicTrack> tracks;

7. library = new ArrayList<>();
   cs101 = new ArrayList<>();
   tracks = new ArrayList<>();

8. The value would be 10

9. Since we learned that collections always start from 0 instead of 1, the fifth element of would be 4: items.get(4);

10. Again, the loic here is the same as that of the previous question. 0-14, so the last item would be 14

11. files.add(favoriteTrack);

12. dates.remove(2);

13. It will now be at index 5
