4. private ArrayList<Book> Library;

5. ArrayList<Student> cs101;

6. private ArrayList<MusicTrack> tracks;

7. library = new ArrayList<>();
   cs101 = new ArrayList<>();
   tracks = new ArrayList<>();

8. The value would be 10

9. Since we learned that collections always start from 0 instead of 1, the fifth element of would be 4: items.get(4);

10. Again, the loic here is the same as that of the previous question. 0-14, so the last item would be 14

11. 

12.
